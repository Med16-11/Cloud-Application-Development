### Task 4
#### Thread APIs:
Each process has at least one thread, but many times it has several threads with varying lifespans. There are no significant differences between threads that belong to distinct processes other than the fact that they share the same memory space and execution context. With respect to the same, you need to work on threads related to their proposed project and upload it on git.
