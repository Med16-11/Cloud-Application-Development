### Vehicle Renting System

An online platform that allows users to search for and rent vehicles from a fleet of vehicles owned by a rental company. The system would likely include features such 
as a user-friendly interface for searching and reserving vehicles, options for different types of vehicles and rental lengths, and a secure payment system. Additionally, the system may also include tools for managing the fleet of vehicles, such as tracking maintenance schedules and monitoring usage. Overall, the goal of the system is to provide a convenient and efficient way for individuals and businesses to rent vehicles on demand.
